The ability of NoSQL databases to horizontally scale more effectively than SQL databases is rooted in their fundamental design principles and architectures. Here's a detailed explanation:

### 1. **Data Model**
- **NoSQL Databases:** Typically use flexible schema designs, such as key-value pairs, document stores, column-family stores, or graph databases. This flexibility allows for the easy distribution of data across multiple nodes.
- **SQL Databases:** Use a fixed schema with tables, rows, and columns. The rigid structure makes it more challenging to distribute data without compromising the integrity of relationships and transactions.

### 2. **Sharding**
- **NoSQL Databases:** Designed with sharding in mind. Sharding involves splitting data across multiple nodes, allowing for efficient distribution and retrieval. Each shard operates independently, making it easier to add or remove nodes as needed.
- **SQL Databases:** Can also use sharding, but itâ€™s more complex to implement. Maintaining ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties across shards requires sophisticated mechanisms, making it less straightforward than in NoSQL databases.

### 3. **Consistency Models**
- **NoSQL Databases:** Often favor eventual consistency over strong consistency. This means they can tolerate temporary inconsistencies across nodes, which simplifies horizontal scaling and allows for higher availability and partition tolerance.
- **SQL Databases:** Typically use strong consistency models. Ensuring that all nodes are always in sync (strong consistency) across distributed environments adds complexity to horizontal scaling.

### 4. **Replication**
- **NoSQL Databases:** Often use masterless architectures or master-slave replication that can handle write operations on multiple nodes, making it easier to scale horizontally.
- **SQL Databases:** Generally rely on master-slave replication where only the master node handles writes, creating a bottleneck. While multi-master setups exist, they are complex and harder to manage.

### 5. **Transaction Management**
- **NoSQL Databases:** Designed to handle simpler, denormalized data models without the need for complex transactions. This reduces the overhead and simplifies distribution across nodes.
- **SQL Databases:** Designed for complex transactions involving multiple tables and rows. Ensuring ACID properties in a distributed environment complicates horizontal scaling.

### 6. **Query Patterns**
- **NoSQL Databases:** Optimized for specific query patterns (e.g., key-value lookups, document retrievals) that can be efficiently distributed across nodes.
- **SQL Databases:** Use a general-purpose query language (SQL) that supports complex joins, aggregations, and nested queries, which can be challenging to distribute and scale horizontally.

### Conclusion
The inherent flexibility, simpler consistency models, and architectural designs of NoSQL databases make them better suited for horizontal scaling. SQL databases, with their rigid schema, complex transaction management, and strong consistency requirements, face more challenges when scaling horizontally.
