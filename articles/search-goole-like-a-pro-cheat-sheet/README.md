## How to do that 
Did you know that Google doesn't just process your text inputs, but also supports a range of operators to enhance the efficiency of your searches? By using these operators, you can precisely search for what you want. For example, you can search for content within a specific website or indicate that all results must include a specific text. Let's explore these capabilities further.

## Search Symbols
