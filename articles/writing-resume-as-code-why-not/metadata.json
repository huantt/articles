I envisioned a resume builder that could accept input in the form of a structured data format, such as `JSON` or `YAML`, and utilize the simplicity and versatility of `Markdown` to craft content. In doing so, users could effortlessly export their own data, then import to other tools that use the same structure that including other Resume builder tools. We can build a ecosystem together.\n\n## The main features\n\n#### 1/ Powered by Markdown Format\n\nMarkdown is a simple and widely-used formatting language, making it easy for users to create and edit their resumes. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, Markdown is a user-friendly choice.\n\n#### 2/ Write with Familiar Language by YAML\n\nWriting your resume in YAML, a human-readable data serialization format, ensures that your resume content is both structured and intuitive. \n\n#### 3/ Manage Multiple Resumes\nFor those with diverse skill sets or looking to apply for various positions, `\"Resume as Code\"` enables you to manage multiple resume.\n\n#### 4/ Easy Export and Sharing\n\nAfter writed and saved Resume, you can export to not only PDF but also JSON or YAML.\n\n#### 5/ You Own All Your Data\n\nI understand the importance of privacy and data ownership. Unlike other online platforms, `\"Resume as Code\"` stores all your data locally, ensuring that your sensitive personal and professional information remains in your control.\n\n### Let’s try it out\nhttps://topcv.vercel.app/\n\n### Opensource\n\nI've just published the source code here: \n\nhttps://github.com/huantt/resume-as-code","body_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fiv6l4t1rwkupbu0ubgap.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fiv6l4t1rwkupbu0ubgap.png\" alt=\"Image description\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"409\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\n  \u003ca name=\"why-i-developed-resume-as-code\" href=\"#why-i-developed-resume-as-code\"\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  Why I Developed Resume as Code\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI've explored various CV builder platforms over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, I encountered a host of issues that left me unsatisfied.\u003cbr\u003e\nThese issues included the inability to format my content precisely the way I wanted and a limited choice of components to truly showcase my skills and experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\nFurthermore, transitioning between different platforms requires me to manual copy-pasting of my data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese problems inspired me to create the \u003ccode\u003e\"Resume as Code\"\u003c/code\u003e tool.
