## About
This is the "single source of trust" that stores all my articles.

It utilizes [huantt/article-as-code](https://github.com/huantt/article-as-code) to collect, store, and sync all my articles to various platforms, including [dev.to](https://dev.to) and [hashnode.dev](https://hashnode.dev).

## Run Locally
The `docker-compose.yml` file helps us run the flow locally.

To run this Docker Compose, create a `.secret.txt` file and fill in the following variables:
- `DEVTO_TOKEN`: Your Dev.to authentication token.
- `DEVTO_USERNAME`: Your Dev.to username.
- `HASHNODE_TOKEN`: Your Hashnode authentication token.
- `HASHNODE_USERNAME`: Your Hashnode username.

Run the following command:
```shell
docker-compose up
```

## GitHub Action
I have created a GitHub action in the `.github/workflows` directory that runs every 6 hours or whenever you commit to the `main` branch.
